# Welcome to TDD Example

*Integer stack*

Develop a class implementing the classic Stack datastructure containing integer values. That is, it should support the following operations:

* Push(value) - adds a value to top of the stack

* value Pop() - removes the top element of the stack and returns that value

* int Count() - returns the current number of elements contained in the stack

Comment by Jeff: Demonstrates technique well but solution is a bit too trivial, which can shortchange the value of TDD
